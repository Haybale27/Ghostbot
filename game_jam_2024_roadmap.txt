Set up: Create github repo.
(done)a. install godot 4 on both laptops
(done)b. set up project folder
c. import assets
ca. robot
cb. tilemap

Enemy Concepts:
1. Turret, mounted anywhere, walls, ceiling, floor.
2. Big mech on treads with slow rocket boost, not for mobility but just to get to platforms
3. Little drone that flies
4. Basic human-form robot.



1. Core gameplay
a. Ghost movement
b. Create robot with basic controls
c. Possession ability
d. Design a system that allows stats to transfer into new possessions and
smoothly hands-off controls between ghost and possession without deleting it

2. Core room mechanics
a. Create tileset and set layers
b. When in ghost-form, room dims and possessable robots have higher contrast,
your ghost becomes visible as well as the evil ghosts in full opacity
c. When in physical-form, all ghosts have less opacity and room is fully lit

3. Player combat
a. Create aiming system/mouse tracking
b. Make bullet script or 2

4. Robot enemies
a. Create state system of idle, track, and attack
b. Create movement functions
c. Create shooting functions
d. Create Player tracking functions

5. Minions
a. Add constant timer in ghost-state
b. Coorelate minion spawns with timer
3. Add player tracking and basic movement
4. Add idle state

6. Environmental hazards



Intermission: By this point switching between ghost and robot state, combat with enemies,
minion behaviors in ghost-state, and a room or 2 should all be implemented for player testing.

By this point the base game is developed and what needs to be focused on is the 
roadmap/progression of the game, more robot types, brainstorming of unique items or
powerups, brainstorming what each floor's unique gimmick is, and making a boss for each floor.
